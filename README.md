# AlgoLense
A modular C-based learning system for beginners to explore Data Structures and Algorithms through multiple approaches and performance comparison,
CodeVariation is a comprehensive Data Structures & Algorithms practice project written entirely in C, where each problem statement is implemented using multiple approaches.
The aim is to help learners compare different techniques, improve problem-solving skills, and understand how algorithmic choices impact performance with flowcharts.

This project is designed as a personal learning repo, but can also be used as a reference for students practicing C programming, DSA fundamentals, and coding interview preparation.
